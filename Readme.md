Key Considerations for Django Backend
1. File Upload and Processing
- Use Django's File Storage System:
    Configure FileField or ImageField for handling uploads.
    Use cloud storage backends like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage with django-storages.
    Chunked File Uploads:
    For large files, implement resumable uploads using tools like tus.io or a custom solution.
- Celery for Asynchronous Processing:
    Handle transcoding tasks asynchronously with Celery and a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ or Redis).

2. Video Transcoding
- Integrate FFmpeg:
    Use Python wrappers like ffmpeg-python or shell commands for transcoding.
- Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) Streaming:
    Generate multiple resolutions and save in HLS or DASH formats.

3. Content Delivery
- Leverage CDNs:
    Use Django to generate signed URLs for secured access to files stored in a CDN (e.g., AWS CloudFront, Akamai).
- Dynamic Media URLs:
    Generate playback URLs with tokens for secure access.

4. User Authentication and Permissions
- Use Django's built-in User model or extend it with a custom user model.
- Implement authentication with JWT (using djangorestframework-simplejwt).
- Secure streaming with DRM integration.

5. API Development
- Build APIs using Django REST Framework (DRF).
- Implement endpoints for:
- User Interaction: Content browsing, likes, comments, etc.
- Playback Requests: Fetch URLs for videos in various formats.
- Analytics Collection: User behavior tracking (play/pause events).
- Use throttling and caching for high-performance APIs.

6. Database Design
- Use a relational database like PostgreSQL.
- Key models could include:
- MediaContent: Stores metadata (title, description, upload date, etc.).
- TranscodedFile: Tracks transcoded versions (resolution, format).
- UserHistory: Stores user watch history and progress.

8. Monitoring and Scalability
- Use Django signals to track user events (e.g., video playback start).
- Integrate monitoring tools like Sentry for error tracking.
- Scale using Docker, Kubernetes, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
